The\\npatient was in his usual state of health, able to walk ?????? mile\\nbefore becoming winded until three to four days ago when he\\ndeveloped rhinorrhea and congestion.  Then one day later he\\ndeveloped shortness of breath, cough, chills and increased\\ndyspnea on exertion.  He also commenced sharp, substernal\\nnonradiating chest pain which he rated 4 out of 10 in\\nintensity.  This pain was relieved with rest and worsened\\nwith cough.  He did have one episode of dry heaves.  He\\ndenied green or yellow sputum, hemoptysis or fevers.  Of\\nnote, the patient has had poor dietary compliance of late,\\neating a large Chinese food dinner three to four nights prior\\nto arrival.  He does deny paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and\\nnew orthopnea, although at baseline he sleeps on four\\npillows.  He does note one day of bilateral lower extremity\\nedema.  He has had good urine output by report and no changes\\nin medicine.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  1.  Coronary artery disease;\\n2.

Dipentum  750 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\n\\nThe patient reports compliance with medications and no recent\\nchange in medications.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  160 pack year history of smoking, quit 12\\nyears ago, no alcohol use, no recreational drug use.  The\\npatient lives with his wife [**Name (NI) 3771**] in [**Name (NI) 3772**].  He owned a\\ntravel agency company.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, heartrate 85, blood\\npressure 111/66, oxygen saturation 92 to 96% on 5 liters by\\nface mask.  General:  Obese male in no acute distress on face\\nmask.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat:  Pupils are equal,\\nround, and reactive to light.  Mucous membranes dry.  No oral\\nlesions.  Neck:  Supple, full range of motion, no\\njugulovenous distension appreciated.  Chest:  Bilateral\\ncrackles at the bases, right greater than left.  Cardiac:\\nDistant heartsounds, regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and\\nS2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated.  Abdomen:\\nDistended, soft, nontender, some shifting dullness.\\nExtremities, trace pedal edema, no calf tenderness.  Other:\\nFoley catheter in place.  Two antecubital intravenous lines\\nin place.\\n\\nLABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs revealed sodium 136,\\nhemolyzed potassium 6.5, repeated 6.0, chloride 98,\\nbicarbonate 25, BUN 33, creatinine 2.0, glucose 108.  White\\nblood cell count 16.3, hematocrit 43.8, platelets 457, MCV\\n78, RDW 15.5.  Differential:  Neutrophils 59, bands 35,\\nlymphocytes 3, atypicals 2, PT 29.8, PTT 47.7, INR 5.9.\\nCardiac enzymes, CK 110, CK MB 3, troponin I 3.2.  Sputum\\nculture:  Reddish brown in appearance.  Chest x-ray:  Right\\nmiddle lobe infiltrate, cardiomegaly.  Electrocardiogram, no\\nST segment changes, no Q waves, rate 99, normal axis, normal\\nintervals.\\n\\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  When the patient presented to the Emergency\\nDepartment he received an aspirin and because he was thought\\nto be in congestive heart failure he also received 100 mg of\\nLasix intravenously spread out over two doses.  He also\\nreceived sublingual nitroglycerin paste.  This brought his\\nblood pressure in to the 90s, at which time the patient was\\nremoved.  In the Emergency Department the patient also\\nreceived Ceftriaxone, 1 gm intravenously times one. He was\\nsubsequently admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.\\n\\n1.  Pulmonary - Because the patient was presumed to have\\ncommunity-acquired pneumonia, by clinical presentation and\\nchest x-ray he was started on Levofloxacin 500 mg p.o. q.\\nday.  He continued this regimen for the remainder of his\\nhospital stay and after discharge, such that he would\\ncomplete a 14 day course.  The patient was given Atrovent\\nmetered dose inhalers initially q. 4 hours and then q. 6\\nhours and this appeared to help with his oxygen saturation\\nand dyspnea.  In addition he was placed on Albuterol prn\\nnebulizers and then metered dose inhalers.  His initial\\noxygen requirement in the Intensive Care Unit was 12 liters\\nby face mask with an FIO2 of .5 and was subsequently weaned\\nfrom the face mask to a nasal cannula once on the floor.  His\\noxygen requirement slowly improved while in-house, however,\\nhis saturations frequently dropped while ambulating.\\n\\n2.  Cardiovascular - For the patient's hypotension, he\\nreceived a 500 cc normal saline bolus over night long in the\\nIntensive Care Unit.  His systolic blood pressure improved to\\nthe 100s, subsequently.  His Cozaar and Carvedilol were held\\nat that time but returned gradually over the next few days as\\nhis pressures continued to rise to an appropriate level.  He\\nwas also gently diuresed on Lasix approximately 20 mg\\nintravenously q.o.d.  His blood pressure was monitored for\\nthe remainder of his inpatient stay and remains approximately\\nin the 1-teens/70s.  The patient was diuresed approximately\\n500 to 1000 cc per day.  For his atrial fibrillation/atrial\\nflutter, he was continued on Amiodarone 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.\\nIn terms of septicemia the patient was negative CK times\\nthree.  His initial troponin I was 3.2 and the following\\ntroponin I was 1.7.  There were no electrocardiogram changes\\nand he experienced no chest pain while in the hospital.\\n\\n3.  Infectious disease - The Gram stain of the patient's\\nsputum showed multiple organisms consistent with oral\\npharyngeal Flora.  The sputum culture grew out oropharyngeal\\norganisms as well as moderate coagulase positive\\nStaphylococcus growth.  He remained afebrile for the\\nremainder of his inpatient stay and he was continued on his\\n14 day regimen of Levofloxacin 500 mg.\\n\\n4.  Heme - As the patient's INR and PT were initially\\nelevated, his Coumadin was held until the INR began to drop.\\nAs the INR began to normalize, the Coumadin was slowly\\nreturned.  Of note, his PTT was elevated as were his\\nfibrinogen and haptoglobin.  His FDT and D-dimer were also\\nmildly elevated.  It was unclear how much of this was due to\\nmild DIC, how much due to acute phase reaction and how much\\ndue to underproduction of coagulation factors by the liver.\\n\\n5.  Oncology - Because the patient's PTT remained elevated\\nwithout explanation while in-house and because he had not\\nreceived regular follow up after his Hodgkin's disease an\\noncology consultation was obtained.  At the consults\\nrecommendation we suggested that the patient follow up with\\nhis previous oncologist in [**State 108**] while he is visiting there\\nnext month.  He should undergo a surveillance computerized\\ntomography scan as well as a possible gallium scan, PET scan\\nand/or bone marrow biopsy.\\n\\n6.  Renal - The patient initially appeared to have some\\ndegree of acute and chronic renal failure, given his elevated\\nBUN and creatinine.  His creatinine decreased to 1.7 after\\nthe 500 cc bolus and continued to trend down thereafter.  BUN\\nand creatinine were monitored throughout the remainder of the\\nstay.\\n\\n7.  Gastrointestinal - For his history of Crohn's disease\\nwith chronic diarrhea, the patient was maintained on Asacol\\n800 mg p.o. t.i.d.  He also received Protonix and Colace prn.\\n\\n\\n8.  Endocrine - Because of a history of hypothyroidism, the\\npatient was maintained on his Synthroid.\\n\\n9.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was\\nmaintained on a cardiac diet as tolerated.  Fluids were not\\ngiven after the patient was transferred from the Intensive\\nCare Unit to the floor because of his likely congestive heart\\nfailure.\\n\\n10.

       "\"date of birth: sex: m service: chief complaint: shortness of breath, cough, increased dyspnea on exertion. history of present illness: this is a year old male with a history of congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction of to %, status post three vessel coronary artery bypass graft, likely chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a admission for pansensitive streptococcus pneumococcal pneumonia who presented yesterday with shortness of breath for two days, a cough productive of white sputum, chills, and increased dyspnea on exertion. the patient was in his usual state of health, able to walk ?????? mile before becoming winded until three to four days ago when he developed rhinorrhea and congestion. then one day later he developed shortness of breath, cough, chills and increased dyspnea on exertion. he also commenced sharp, substernal nonradiating chest pain which he rated out of in intensity. this pain was relieved with rest and worsened with cough. he did have one episode of dry heaves. he denied green or yellow sputum, hemoptysis or fevers. of note, the patient has had poor dietary compliance of late, eating a large chinese food dinner three to four nights prior to arrival. he does deny paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and new orthopnea, although at baseline he sleeps on four pillows. he does note one day of bilateral lower extremity edema. he has had good urine output by report and no changes in medicine. past medical/surgical history: coronary artery disease; status post coronary artery bypass graft in (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending, saphenous vein graft to obtuse marginal of circumflex, saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery); congestive heart failure, ejection fraction of to % with moderate mitral regurgitation, ejection fraction of less than %; anteroapical aneurysm; silent myocardial infarction; mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; left pneumothorax with chest tube placement; atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter; hypertension; head and neck cancer, status post resection; hodgkin's disease, stage b with bone marrow infiltration in , underwent six cycles of abvd, torso computerized tomography scan and gallium scan were negative as were bone marrow biopsy times two; question of crohn's; nephrolithiasis; mild chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of ; left lower lobe pneumococcal pneumonia in ; hypothyroidism; status post hernia repair years ago. medications: lipitor mg p.o. q.d. lasix mg p.o. q.d. k-dur meq p.o. b.i.d. coumadin mg p.o. tuesday, thursday, saturday and sunday, mg p.o. monday, wednesday and friday synthroid mcg p.o. q.d. carvedilol mg p.o. b.i.d. cozaar mg p.o. q.d. amiodarone mg p.o. q.d. theophylline mg p.o. q.h.s. dipentum mg p.o. b.i.d. the patient reports compliance with medications and no recent change in medications. social history: pack year history of smoking, quit years ago, no alcohol use, no recreational drug use. the patient lives with his wife in . he owned a travel agency company. physical examination: temperature , heartrate , blood pressure /, oxygen saturation to % on liters by face mask. general: obese male in no acute distress on face mask. head, eyes, ears, nose and throat: pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. mucous membranes dry. no oral lesions. neck: supple, full range of motion, no jugulovenous distension appreciated. chest: bilateral crackles at the bases, right greater than left. cardiac: distant heartsounds, regular rate and rhythm. normal s and s, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated. abdomen: distended, soft, nontender, some shifting dullness. extremities, trace pedal edema, no calf tenderness. other: foley catheter in place. two antecubital intravenous lines in place. laboratory data: admission labs revealed sodium , hemolyzed potassium , repeated , chloride , bicarbonate , bun , creatinine , glucose white blood cell count , hematocrit , platelets , mcv , rdw differential: neutrophils , bands , lymphocytes , atypicals , pt , ptt , inr cardiac enzymes, ck , ck mb , troponin i sputum culture: reddish brown in appearance. chest x-ray: right middle lobe infiltrate, cardiomegaly. electrocardiogram, no st segment changes, no q waves, rate , normal axis, normal intervals. hospital course: when the patient presented to the emergency department he received an aspirin and because he was thought to be in congestive heart failure he also received mg of lasix intravenously spread out over two doses. he also received sublingual nitroglycerin paste. this brought his blood pressure in to the s, at which time the patient was removed. in the emergency department the patient also received ceftriaxone, gm intravenously times one. he was subsequently admitted to the medical intensive care unit. pulmonary - because the patient was presumed to have community-acquired pneumonia, by clinical presentation and chest x-ray he was started on levofloxacin mg p.o. q. day. he continued this regimen for the remainder of his hospital stay and after discharge, such that he would complete a day course. the patient was given atrovent metered dose inhalers initially q. hours and then q. hours and this appeared to help with his oxygen saturation and dyspnea. in addition he was placed on albuterol prn nebulizers and then metered dose inhalers. his initial oxygen requirement in the intensive care unit was liters by face mask with an fio of . and was subsequently weaned from the face mask to a nasal cannula once on the floor. his oxygen requirement slowly improved while in-house, however, his saturations frequently dropped while ambulating. cardiovascular - for the patient's hypotension, he received a cc normal saline bolus over night long in the intensive care unit. his systolic blood pressure improved to the s, subsequently. his cozaar and carvedilol were held at that time but returned gradually over the next few days as his pressures continued to rise to an appropriate level. he was also gently diuresed on lasix approximately mg intravenously q.o.d. his blood pressure was monitored for the remainder of his inpatient stay and remains approximately in the -teens/s. the patient was diuresed approximately to cc per day. for his atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter, he was continued on amiodarone mg p.o. b.i.d. in terms of septicemia the patient was negative ck times three. his initial troponin i was and the following troponin i was there were no electrocardiogram changes and he experienced no chest pain while in the hospital. infectious disease - the gram stain of the patient's sputum showed multiple organisms consistent with oral pharyngeal flora. the sputum culture grew out oropharyngeal organisms as well as moderate coagulase positive staphylococcus growth. he remained afebrile for the remainder of his inpatient stay and he was continued on his day regimen of levofloxacin mg. heme - as the patient's inr and pt were initially elevated, his coumadin was held until the inr began to drop. as the inr began to normalize, the coumadin was slowly returned. of note, his ptt was elevated as were his fibrinogen and haptoglobin. his fdt and d-dimer were also mildly elevated. it was unclear how much of this was due to mild dic, how much due to acute phase reaction and how much due to underproduction of coagulation factors by the liver. oncology - because the patient's ptt remained elevated without explanation while in-house and because he had not received regular follow up after his hodgkin's disease an oncology consultation was obtained. at the consults recommendation we suggested that the patient follow up with his previous oncologist in while he is visiting there next month. he should undergo a surveillance computerized tomography scan as well as a possible gallium scan, pet scan and/or bone marrow biopsy. renal - the patient initially appeared to have some degree of acute and chronic renal failure, given his elevated bun and creatinine. his creatinine decreased to after the cc bolus and continued to trend down thereafter. bun and creatinine were monitored throughout the remainder of the stay. gastrointestinal - for his history of crohn's disease with chronic diarrhea, the patient was maintained on asacol mg p.o. t.i.d. he also received protonix and colace prn. endocrine - because of a history of hypothyroidism, the patient was maintained on his synthroid. fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - the patient was maintained on a cardiac diet as tolerated. fluids were not given after the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the floor because of his likely congestive heart failure. code - the patient was full code. prophylaxis - the patient was kept on protonix. his inr was therapeutic or supertherapeutic throughout the hospital stay and so no further deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was required. disposition: the patient was discharged home to rehabilitation once he was able to ambulate without dropping his saturations into the s. discharge diagnosis: community acquired pneumonia congestive heart failure discharge medications: cozaar mg p.o. q.d. carvedilol mg p.o. b.i.d. amiodarone mg p.o. q.d. levofloxacin mg p.o. q.d. times nine days lipitor mg p.o. q.d. asacol mg p.o. t.i.d. colace mg p.o. b.i.d. prn synthroid mcg p.o. q.d. tylenol mg p.o. q. to hours prn atrovent metered dose inhalers to puffs q.i.d. albuterol metered dose inhaler to puffs q.i.d. prn protonix mg p.o. q.d. lasix mg p.o. q.d. coumadin p.o. mg on tuesday, thursday, saturday and sunday, mg monday, wednesday and friday k-dur meq p.o. b.i.d. follow up: the patient should follow up with his primary care physician, . the patient should follow up with his oncologist in , regarding surveillance for his hodgkin's disease , md dictated by: medquist d: : t: : job#:\""
